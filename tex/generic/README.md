# LaTeX Generic Classes, Styles and Macros

## The `coursework` Classes

Contains the latest versions of two LaTeX 3 classes: `pset` and `notes`. These are designed to be used by college students or instructors to typeset materials relating to primarily Science and Mathematics courses, although they can be easily used in the Humanities and Social Sciences as well, if you are so inclined. They share common functionality and a unified design.

## The `lingtex` Classes

A collection of LaTeX files for linguists.
