## UNICODE Font Table

This package produces font tables for unicode fonts as well as for 8bit fonts. The table layout can be adjusted in various ways including restricting the range of output to show only a portion of a specific font. The official package source can be found at <https://github.com/FrankMittelbach/fmitex-unicodefonttable/>.
